# ML enhanced radiation 

This repository contains the code for the ML-enhanced radiation scheme which is based on [RTE+RRTMGP](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp) used in the [ICON Model](https://gitlab.dkrz.de/icon/icon-model). The corresponding paper is submitted to the Journal Geoscientific Model Development. 


If you want to use this repository, you can start by executing
```
conda env create -f environment_ml.yml
conda activate hafner1_ml_rad
```
for training and evaluation the ML-based part.

If you want to use [pyrte-rrtmgp](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/pyRTE-RRTMGP), activate the following environment
```
conda env create -f environment_pyrte.yml
conda activate hafner1_pyrte_rrtmgp
```
